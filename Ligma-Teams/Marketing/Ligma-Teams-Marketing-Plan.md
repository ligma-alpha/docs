# Ligma Teams Marketing Plan
## Why market Ligma Teams?

After Ligma came together to launch an NFTeams syndicate it gives Ligma an opportunity to be a ‘presence’ in the NFTeams space. 

Apart from the obvious benefits of increasing our chances of winning prizes with the 50+ teams, the syndicate gives Ligma a chance to be a respected authority amongst the NFTeams community due to the large holdings of teams. 

To take advantage of this, it makes sense to build on this opportunity and gain some exposure through various marketing efforts with the aim of bringing future advantages to all things Ligma.

This can be done in many ways, and can bring several benefits such as:

* Networking effect - exposure can bring new relationships and opportunities that could be beneficial to Ligma
* Future marketing benefit for Ligma - the marketing effort we produce now will build a reputation and a following within the NFTeams community (and hopefully further abroad) that can be used for any other future marketing efforts that may be associated to future Ligma projects (NFT drops/tools etc)
* Keeping our finger on the pulse - to create effective NFTeams related marketing content, we’ll need to make sure we’re fully up to date with everything related to the project.
* This will keep us on our toes when following updates, new developments etc
*It’ll be fun innit 

With that in mind, it makes sense to come up with a simple plan in order to maximise the effectiveness of our efforts. The plan will not be extensive and is not designed to add any unnecessary workload that will take the fun out of doing this. 

## How to market Ligma Teams
### Social Media

**Twitter**

Ligma Teams Twitter account already set up - https://twitter.com/LigmaTeams

_Account Managers:_

* Borrid
* LenBets

_Twitter Content Subjects:_

* Ligma Teams’ teams (profiles etc)
* NFTeams updates/new/announcements
* NFTeams Tournaments and Ligma Teams progress 
* NFTeams stats (floor prices/tournament stats/other)

Twitter ‘tone of voice’ will be fun/playful/banter but with a plan to showcase some of the best NFTeams related facts and stats thanks to some of the data guys we have in Ligma. 

All Ligma members are encouraged to contribute tweet ideas/threads. Please get in touch with Borrid or LenBets

It’s also important to engage with the NFTeams twitter community by replying, liking re-tweeting, and just generally taking part in relevant conversations.

_Other ideas:_

* Change teams names

**Discord**

### Website

As a part of our efforts it makes sense to have a Ligma Teams website for people to go and find out more about the syndicate. This could link in to any future Ligma website that is created for future products. 

There should be relevant content on the site to make this work. At the very least there should be a blog with fun/useful/interesting/entertaining/educational posts about NFTeams and Ligma Teams (and possibly the wider NFT space).

**Quick win idea 1:** get people who are already creating NFTeams content to transfer it to the Ligma Teams website. This would mean minimal effort for Ligma but could mean increased exposure for whoever signs on. They could also be compensated with Ligma passes.

**Quick win idea 2:** Sponsor NFTeams content to gain exposure

**Quick win idea 3:** Advertise within NFTeam for people willing to create content for us in exchange for access to the Ligma server

_Content ideas:_

* Blog posts 
* Podcasts 
* Ligma Steve’s tournament bracket viewer
* Stats sections

## Branding 

* Ligma Teams’ logo does not relate to NFTeams. The logo is similar to the Rolling Stones logo so anyone not familiar with Ligma Teams may be confused about its purpose.
* Ligma Teams’ branding should be in line with NFTeams so people are clear about the relationship. Suggestions would be colours, text, discussions
* Ligma Teams comms should try stay consistent across all platforms (might be tough sell this :))
* Discord name should match Twitter name to make sure people are clear that it is the same syndicate
* Change team names for Ligma
